		Polnareff, have you ever considered why humans wish to live?
		Humans live hoping to conquer their anxieties and fear, and attain peace of mind.
		Seeking fame, controlling others, and acquiring wealth are all done to achieve peace of mind.
		Marriage and friendship are also pursued as means of attaining peace of mind.
		When humans say they wish to help others, or that a thing is done for love or justice...it's all merely to give themselves peace of mind.
		To achieve peace of mind is the goal of all mankind.
		Now, given that, what anxiety could you possibly feel towards serving me?
		Any other peace of mind would come easily if you do.
		Doesn't challenging me, even knowing that it may spell your death, bring you anxiety?
		You are a very capable Stand user.
		It's a waste to kill you.
		Why not cut ties with Joestar and the others, and serve me for eternity?
		I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.
