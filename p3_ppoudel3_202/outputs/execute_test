		But no matter how strong I became, your power still exceeded mine... 
		At first, I thought it was your loved ones: that it was your instinct to protect them that spurred you on and pushed you beyond your limits. 
		And certainly, that was part of it. 
		I've seen enough of that clown smile to know how much they mean to you. 
		But over the years, I realized there was more. 
		I made a family of my own and it still wasn't the key. 
		It's something else in the way you approach a battle... I used to fight for the sheer pleasure of it, sparing no one. 
		I killed for dominance and to feed my insatiable pride. 
		But you never fought to kill or even to win, only to test your limits and become the strongest you could possibly be. 
		You showed mercy to everyone, even your fiercest enemies, even me! 
		As if you knew one day I would possess this tiny sliver of a soul... 
		How can a Saiyan fight with such power and at the same time be so gentle?! 
		It makes me angry just thinking about it... 
		Or perhaps it's my anger that's made me blind to the truth for so long. 
		I see it now... 
		I only fought to push down others, you only fight to push yourself! 
		Hang in there, Kakarot! 
		You are number one!

		Polnareff, have you ever considered why humans wish to live?
		Humans live hoping to conquer their anxieties and fear, and attain peace of mind.
		Seeking fame, controlling others, and acquiring wealth are all done to achieve peace of mind.
		Marriage and friendship are also pursued as means of attaining peace of mind.
		When humans say they wish to help others, or that a thing is done for love or justice...it's all merely to give themselves peace of mind.
		To achieve peace of mind is the goal of all mankind.
		Now, given that, what anxiety could you possibly feel towards serving me?
		Any other peace of mind would come easily if you do.
		Doesn't challenging me, even knowing that it may spell your death, bring you anxiety?
		You are a very capable Stand user.
		It's a waste to kill you.
		Why not cut ties with Joestar and the others, and serve me for eternity?
		I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.

262$I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what.
After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.
Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
