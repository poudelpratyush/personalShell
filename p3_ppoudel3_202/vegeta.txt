But no matter how strong I became, your power still exceeded mine... 
At first, I thought it was your loved ones: that it was your instinct to protect them that spurred you on and pushed you beyond your limits. 
And certainly, that was part of it. 
I've seen enough of that clown smile to know how much they mean to you. 
But over the years, I realized there was more. 
I made a family of my own and it still wasn't the key. 
It's something else in the way you approach a battle... I used to fight for the sheer pleasure of it, sparing no one. 
I killed for dominance and to feed my insatiable pride. 
But you never fought to kill or even to win, only to test your limits and become the strongest you could possibly be. 
You showed mercy to everyone, even your fiercest enemies, even me! 
As if you knew one day I would possess this tiny sliver of a soul... 
How can a Saiyan fight with such power and at the same time be so gentle?! 
It makes me angry just thinking about it... 
Or perhaps it's my anger that's made me blind to the truth for so long. 
I see it now... 
I only fought to push down others, you only fight to push yourself! 
Hang in there, Kakarot! 
You are number one!
